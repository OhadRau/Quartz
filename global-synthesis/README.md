# global-synthesis

Based on [Multiparty Compatability in Communicating Automata: 
Characterisation and Synthesis of Global Session Types](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.1902.pdf).

Implements an inference system that turns local views of multiparty session types into global multiparty session 
types, eventually for use in the Quartz compiler. Can be thought of as stage 2 of the compiler's typing pipeline.
